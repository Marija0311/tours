It was worth it to have the tickets through Get Your Guide instead of standing in the long ticket lines. We took the 7pm boat cruise and saw the lights twinkling from the Eiffle tower at 8pm. Spectacular!",

The halls and corridors just go on forever taking you from room to room to see all the amazing pieces. The painted ceilings are fantastic and the Sistine Chapel is definately a must see.',
